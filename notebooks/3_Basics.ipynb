    "Testing is a critical part of software development that involves executing a program or a part of the program to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements. Sometimes developers use test-driven development starting by defining tests and then writing the code meeting their requirements. In Python, this can be efficiently done using the `unittest` framework, which is inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logging is the process of recording messages that describe the events occurring within a software application. This can include a variety of information, such as errors encountered, system status, and other diagnostic information. It's a way to automatically track what your program is doing, rather than using `print()` statements.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Writing Log Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "To write log messages, you use methods of the logging module named after the levels. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n",

    "* Advanced Configuration: For more advanced logging configurations, you can define handlers, formatters, and loggers:\n",
    "    * Handlers send the log messages to configured destinations like the standard output, files, or over HTTP.\n",
    "    * Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.\n",
