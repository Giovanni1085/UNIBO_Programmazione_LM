# Group project

The project will allow you to choose a task, dataset, or question of interest, and develop a tool or run an analysis. A project should entail a substantial programming effort that allows you to practice the course contents, and learn more by doing. The project is proposed by you, and it could entail working with text data. You can use the techniques we have seen in class and/or others as well. 

## Practicalities

* **Team size**: teams of 3 people are required, plus or minus one. Groups of 1 are not allowed, except for non-attending students.
* **Contribution**: in the final report plase add a statement of what each team member contributed to the project. Team members will typically get the same grade, but I may differentiate in extreme cases of unequal contribution. You can contact me in confidence in the event of persistent unequal contribution.
*Example: John: Plotting graphs during data analysis, crawling the data, preliminary data analysis; Mary: Problem formulation, writing up the report, coming up with the algorithm; Chris: Coding up the algorithm, running tests, tabulating final results.*
* **Using external resources**: you may use any existing code, library, LLM, the Web, etc. and consult any papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your writeup and clearly indicate which parts of the project are your contribution and which parts were implemented by others. Under no circumstances may you look at another project's code, or incorporate their code into your project.
* **Logistics**: ideally, you should create your project's GitHub (or GitLab) repository and work there (one of you uses their account and the others are invited as collaborators). This will help you start your project portfolio online. This way, you can also submit the project simply by sharing the repository link with me (remember to make it public first). Otherwise, you can work with local folders, just keep in mind this will make things more complicated as you collaborate with others.
* **Final submission**. You are expected to **submit a URL to your public repository**, or a compressed folder sent directly to me via email, containing the following: a short **report** (4-page maximum, excluding references), the **repository** or folder containing code, data and a `README` file with appropriate documentation to navigate the repository (all this with a link to your repository). **Please if possible, put the bulk of the code into a single notebook or script, with a clear structure and dependences.** Your work is going to be assessed based on what you have accomplished, its broader interest and effort required, the correct and non-trivial use of Python, the use of programming or analytical techniques not seen in class, the clarity of your code, comments, documentation, and report.

## Set-up

1. [Repository README template](README_template.md).
2. [Report template](report/): A 4-page, double-column PDF report (4 pages excluding references), following a standard structure (where applicable): abstract, introduction, related work, (brief) data collection, dataset description with summary statistics, methods with math and description of main algorithms, work done, results and findings, conclusions. This report will be evaluated according to how clearly and succinctly it is written, if the style is appropriate (e.g., figures with captions), if it contains all relevant contents, and how solid the results are. If you prefer to work with MS Word or similar, this is also possible: please respect the required structure as close as you can.

## Project ideas and the default project

Ideally, the project idea comes from you. Please remember to validate it with me before starting to work on it.

The **default project** is left quite open for similar reasons. This is what I recommend doing if you do not have specific ideas to work on:
1. Take a look at these lists of datasets:
    * [A list of datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11hCXmGfZBLx1-JPmtaWGv9PutuN7H2mEA35RmqdvDCU/edit?usp=sharing)
    * https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets
    * https://github.com/karthikncode/nlp-datasets
    * https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#naturallanguage
    * https://www.cooldatasets.com/
    * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
2. Pick a dataset you are interested into. Read its documentation, download it or a sample of it, take a closer look.
3. Elaborate some analytical questions you could "ask" or tasks you could accomplish using the dataset. Remember: for higher grades, it is a good idea to go beyond what we have seen in class. For example, you could formulate and execute a quantitative corpus analysis (starting by defining what that should be and why), or you could develop a software to process textual data (e.g., with machine learning), or develop a Website to give access to the corpus.
4. Make a plan, divide work among you, and start iterating. Make sure to stay focused: it is a good idea to give yourself a timeline with deadlines.
5. Feel free to ask me questions (but not to ask me to do work for you!).
