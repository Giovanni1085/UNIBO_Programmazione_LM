## Datasets and exercises

**TODO**

We will use some **datasets** from [this course](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/tree/master/data). Also check out the [list of resources](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/blob/master/ADA-resources.md) from the same course.

## Setting-up your working environment

You can follow all classes and do the exercises using Binder (just click on the badge above).

**Here is a [guide to setup your environment](setup.md), with several other options.**

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

* Option 1 (basic): Use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) (badge above). Keep in mind you need to download your notebooks to save them locally or they will disappear after you close your browser tab. You can link Binder with your Google drive to store notebooks.

* Option 2 (recommended): Download [the repository contents](https://github.com/uvacreate/2021-coding-the-humanities) and use Jyputer Notebook or Jupyter Lab locally. You can do this via Anaconda or Edupyter (Windows). See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.

* Option 3 (advanced): work directly with git and conda using your terminal and preferred editor. See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.

### Editor

You may need an **editor** to write code and edit files. If you don't have a preferred one yet, consider [Thonny via Edupyter](https://www.portabledevapps.net/edupyter.php) (for Windows, see [here for other platforms](https://thonny.org/)) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Valid alternatives are also [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

*[Thonny via Edupyter](https://www.portabledevapps.net/edupyter.php) is the environment of choice for the courses `Linguistica Informatica` and `Linguistica Computazionale`. All students interested in following them are therefore encouraged to use Thonny and Jupyter via Edupyter during this course as well.*
